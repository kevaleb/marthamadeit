			<h2 class="editable">Custom Fit</h2>
			<p class="editable">&nbsp;Every Item is customized just for you. Choose from a variety of options for each style (Sleeve length, Skirt length, Waistband, ect.) You will need to provide your measurements for our "Made to Measure" Items, so we can provide the best fit possible. Our Shop Section has Ready to Wear Items as well. Make sure to measure your Chest, Waist, and Hip and choose the size that your measurements fall under. If you are in between sizes you can email me and I can make a Custom Item just for You! That's what makes us different. Your item is truly one of a kind just like you!</p>

			<h2 class="editable">Fabric Combinations</h2>
			<p class="editable">I love the idea of Original, One of a Kind clothing! So, the fabric choices are always being updated. We use quality, soft, stretch fabrics. All items are machine washable and we recommend you hang dry all our items. We like to keep Beautiful and Trendy Fabrics available for your choosing pleasure. But you have to be quick, we only stock enough for one or two items out of each fabric. And 90% of our fabric is not restocked.</p>
