  - question: What is the Shop Return Policy?
    answer: >-
      Due to the nature of my business I have a strict return policy. My Return
      Policy is as follows: If you provide custom measurements I offer a size
      guarantee. Please take extra care in providing the correct measurements to
      me. If they are wrong I wont be able to offer a refund. If you order a
      general size item (medium, large, ect.) These items are not eligible for a
      refund.  If you receive your item and it does not fit I will be happy to
      take the item back and either replace it, mend it to fit, or give you a
      refund. I do ask that all fit issues be reported and returned within 7
      days after you have received your order. After 10 days you will no longer
      be able to return your item. Because of the Nature of my Business and the
      type of Custom Product I make I do ask that my Customers please follow
      this returning procedure.

  - question: What is the Shop Cancellation Policy?
    answer: >-
      Because of the limited availability of fabric all orders can be canceled
      within 48 hours after purchase and you will receive a full refund. If
      there is some error in your order please contact the shop immediately to
      make any adjustments to your order.
