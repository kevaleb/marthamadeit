			<h2 class="editable">Custom Fit</h2>
			<p class="editable">My favorite part of this site is the "No Size" way we do things. Every Item is customized just for you. You will need to provide your measurements, so we can provide the best fit possible. You do NOT have to fit an ideal body type to order from us but if you do we can make it perfect. That's what makes us different. Your item is truly one of a kind just like you!</p>

			<h2 class="editable">Fabric Combinations</h2>
			<p class="editable">I love the idea of Original, One of a Kind clothing! So, the fabric choices are always being updated. We use quality, soft, stretch fabrics. All items are machine washable and we recommend you hang dry all our items. We like to keep Beautiful and Trendy Fabrics available for your choosing pleasure. But you have to be quick, we only stock enough for one or two items out of each fabric. And 90% of our fabric is not restocked.</p>
