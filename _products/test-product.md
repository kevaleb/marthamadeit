The Mama Mya Top is a Flattering, Comfortable Top or Tunic. This Top is fitted at the bust and flows out towards the waist and hip. Dress the Mama Mya up or don easily with jeans or a Pencil Skirt.&nbsp;

The Fabric I have selected for this Top is Incredibly Soft and Comfortable Stretchy Rayon Fabrics. This fabric is lightweight and flows beautifully, perfect for Spring and Summer.&nbsp;

Choose Your Fabric, Sleeve Length, and Style to Create your one of a kind item. If you have any questions please contact me via my email.&nbsp;
