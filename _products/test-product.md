The Mama Mya Top is a Lovely Comfortable Top! This top is fitted at the bust and flows out towards the waist and hip, making it very flattering and comfortable.

The Fabric I have selected is lightweight Rayon Knit. This fabric is stretchy, soft, and lightweight (perfect for Spring and Summer)!

You may choose any sleeve option below: Short Sleeve, 3/4 Sleeve, or Long Sleeves.

You may Choose between: Shirt Length and Curved Tunic Length.
