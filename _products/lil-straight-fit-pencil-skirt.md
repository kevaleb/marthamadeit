This is the Lil' Pencil Skirt. This skirt is a relaxed, straight fit skirt. You choose from 2 band options an 2 length options. Customize it for you little ones specific tastes. She will love it!&nbsp;

The fabric chosen for this style has plenty of stretch for your little one to play and jump around. Don't worry about her not having room to play. &nbsp;I suggest you Machine Wash and Hang your Items to Dry for lasting Quality.&nbsp;
